### Hi, I'm Dima

Frontend Engineer focused on **architecture, product thinking, and scalable UI systems**.

I build modern web apps using **React / Next.js**, design clean front-end architectures, and connect them to reliable backends (NestJS + Prisma).

---

### 🧠 What I care about
- Clean architecture over quick hacks
- Predictable state and data flow
- Readable code that scales with product complexity
- UI as a system, not a set of components

### 🛠 Tech stack
**Frontend**
- React, Next.js, TypeScript
- TanStack Query, React Hook Form, Zod
- Tailwind, CSS Modules
- FSD architecture

**Backend**
- NestJS, Prisma
- PostgreSQL

**Tooling**
